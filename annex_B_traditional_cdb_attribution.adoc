= Traditional CDB 1.0 Attribution

This table outlines the CDB vector attributes that are exclusively designed for the OGC CDB Standard and cannot be mapped to other schemas, such as NAS.

.Traditional OGC CDB V1.3 attributes extracted from CDB_Attributes.xml file

|===
|*CDB Attribute Name*|*Semantic Definition*

|*Category I) CDB indexes that affect database structure and attribute layout:*|
|Feature Attribute Classification Code (FACC)|This feature code identifies and categorizes feature types. The enumerated codes are listed in ‘/CDB/Metadata/Feature_Data_Dictionary.xml’.
|Feature Sub Code (FSC)|In conjunction with the feature code, this code is used to distinguish and categorize features within a dataset. The enumerated codes are listed in ‘/CDB/Metadata/Feature_Data_Dictionary.xml’.
|Class Name (CNAM)|CNAM is a unique name that represents the Attribution Class schema in a database file. Attributes are referenced via this class name. The class name is used as the primary key to perform searches within the Dataset Class Attribute file. Each row of an instance-level *.dbf can optionally use the CNAM to refer to class attributes; blank indicates “no class attribute”.
|CDB Composite Material Index (CMIX)|CMIX is used to determine the base material composition of the associated features. Refer to the Material Naming Conventions section for a description of material naming conventions. CMIX reference into Composite Material Table, therefore, affects cross-reference structure.
|Light Type (LTYP)|LTYP special instructions are specific to CDB light hierarchy. LTYP is a unique code corresponding to a Light Type. Annex J of this standard provides the supported light types. The light types follow a hierarchical organization provided by the light type naming conventions described in Section 2.3, Light Naming. The Lights.xml file establishes the correspondence between the LTYP code and the Light Type name.
|Moving Model DIS Code (MMDC)|A character string composed of the 7 fields of the DIS Entity Type. The first four fields (kind, domain, country and category) are used to create four subdirectories in the moving model datasets hierarchy. This attribute is mandatory for Moving Model Location features.
|Model Level of Detail (MLOD), Model Name (MODL) and Model Type (MODT)|MLOD is the level of detail of the 3D model that is associated with the point feature, and this attribute affects model instantiation interpretation and thus CDB structure.
|CDB Extended Attribute Index (CEAI), Geomatics Extended Attribute Index (GEAI), or Vendor Extended Attribute Index (VEAI)|An index that points to a row entry of a CDB, Geomatics or Vendor Extended Attribution file for the current dataset. This entry permits users to store an index to a link list set of extra attributes. CDB-compliant devices are not mandated to read and interpret this field. Usage of this attribution is not portable to other simulators because it falls outside of the documented CDB attribution scheme. These Extended Attribution files should be located in the same directory as the instance-level attribution.
|*Category II) CDB model placement and client rendering attributes:*|
|Bounding Boxes Height (BBH), Width (BBW) and Length (BBL)|These attributes define the dimension of the box centered at the model origin and inbound the portion of the model above its XY plane, including the envelopes of all articulated parts. BBH refers to the height of the box above the XY plane of the model, BBW refers to the box's width along the X-axis, and BBL refers to the length of the box along the Y-axis. Note that for 3D models used as cultural features, the XY plane of the model corresponds to its ground reference plane. The value of BBH, BBW and BBL should be accounted for by client devices to determine the appropriate distance at which the model should be paged-in, rendered or processed. BBH, BBW and BBL are usually generated through database authoring tool automation.
|Bounding Sphere Radius (BSR)|In the case where a feature references an associated 3D model, it is the radius of the hemisphere centered at the model origin, and that bounds the portion of the model above its XY plane, including the envelopes of all articulated parts. Note that for 3D models used as cultural features, the XY plane of the model corresponds to its ground reference plane. The value of BSR should be accounted for by client devices (in combination with other information) to determine the appropriate distance the model should be paged-in, rendered or processed. When the feature does not reference a 3D model, BSR is the radius of the abstract point representing the feature (e.g., a city). The dimension of the bounding sphere is intrinsic to the model and identical for all LOD representations.
|Absolute Height Flag (AHGT), and Z Attributes.|Indicates how to interpret the Z component of a feature. If AHGT is true, the feature is positioned to the value specified by the Z component (Absolute Terrain Altitude), irrelevant to the terrain elevation dataset. If AHGT is false or not present, the feature is positioned to the value specified by the underlying terrain offset by the Z component value. When the Z coordinate (altitude) of a feature is relative to the ground, the terrain elevation dataset can be updated without the need to recompute the altitude of the feature.
|Scaling X-Axis (SCALx), Scaling Y-Axis (SCALy), Scaling Z-Axis (SCALz) |These attributes are a set of scaling factors, to be applied to the rendering of model geometry by the client-device. The scaling value should also be accounted for by client devices (in combination with other information) to determine the appropriate distance at which the model should be paged-in, rendered or processed. All three scaling factors are optional, and values of zero and negative values are not permitted.
|Layer Priority Number (LPN)|LPN affects feature depth ordering. LPN describes a priority number that establishes the relative priority of overlapping features. LPN establishes the order (starting from 0 for lowest priority) by which client-devices process overlapping features.
|Relative Tactical Importance (RTAI)|RTAI provides the relative tactical importance of cultural features relative to other features for client-device scene/load management. A value of 100% corresponds to the highest importance; 0% corresponds to the lowest importance. Note that the importance of the model can be further modified at run-time in the simulator console through the scenario importance value assigned to the model.
|*Category III) Cross-referencing between feature geometries, topology, navigation data and CDB datasets:*|
|Junction ID (JID), Start Junction ID (SJID), End Junction ID (EJID) |Junction Identification Number virtually connects a point or a polygon feature to another point, linear or polygon feature. Features stored in the same vector file having the same JID are connected. The linear features stored in the same vector file having the same SJID or EJID as the JID are connected. JID, SJID, and EJID affect cross-references between feature geometries and between datasets via relationship file, affecting database structure.
|Network Dataset Code (NDSC), Network Component Selector 1 (NCS1), Network Component Selector 2 (NCS2)|NDSC Code is used to identify the dataset code file which contains the point, lineal, or polygon feature that is virtually connected. NCS1 Code defines the component selector 1  and the component selector 2 file, respectively. These codes are mandatory for network datasets and affect cross-referencing between datasets
|Taxiway ID (TXID)  |A unique alphanumeric identifier (for the airport in question) that affects cross-references to NavData datasets.
|Airport ID (APID) |APID is a unique alphanumeric identifier that points to a record in the NavData Airport or Heliport dataset (i.e., a link to the airport or the Heliport description in the NavData dataset). This ID is the value of the field Ident of the Airport or Heliport dataset. Note that all the lights located in vector datasets associated with the operation of an airport (including runway lights and lighting systems) are required to reference an airport or heliport in the NavData dataset. All man-made features associated with an airport or heliport must be assigned an APID attribute; the APID attribute is not required for features unrelated to airports or heliports.
|Runway ID (RWID) |An alphanumeric identifier that uniquely identifies a runway for a given airport; this ID must match the value of the field Ident of the Runway or Helipad dataset. RWID is a cross-reference to NavData datasets.
|Gate ID (GAID)|GAID is a unique alphanumeric identifier (for the airport in question) that is consistent with the IDENT attribute name within the NavData Gate dataset. This ID is the value of the Gate Identifier of the Gate dataset and can be used to extract additional information such as the gate position and bearing.
|Length of Lineal (LENL)|The length of a lineal. If the feature has been clipped to a tile boundary, the length still gives the initial full length of the object prior to the clipping operation, and if it belonged to a topological network, LENL will represent the distance between the two closest junction points encompassing this lineal segment.

*Note:*  +
Some geometry attributes in the CDB attribution list (_e.g._,  WGP, HGT, DEP) are used by almost all CDB clients. However, some clients might not use them for rendering. The concepts for those attributes are mentioned in the following table.

.CDB Geometry Attributes
|===
|*Application Schema Geometry Attributes*|

|OGC CDB relies on standard geometry attribution provided by the feature attribute application schema for describing orientation, size, and placement of point, linear, and polygon features and associated models. The specific names and codes of these attributes vary depending on which feature attribute schema standard is in use but must always be present. Description of the feature attribute application schema should indicate which particular role any standard geometry attributes provide. CDB V1.3 and earlier traditionally used DIGEST FACC 2.1 real-valued attributes to model these properties.|
|Angle of Orientation (AO1)|The angular distance measured from the true north (0 deg) clockwise to the feature's major (Y) axis - also known as azimuth or heading. This represents the rotation of a point feature relative to its local Z axis with a range from 0.0 (inclusive) to 360.0 (exclusive) degrees. If not present or specified, a default value of 0.0 degrees should be assumed.
|Width (WGP)|For linear features (such as roads, railways, runways, taxiways), the width is a positive distance measurement of the axis perpendicular to the linear segments.
|Depth below Surface Level (DEP)|The depth of a feature relative to its surface location. If the feature has no modeled representation, its depth is measured as the distance from the surface level to the lowest point of the feature below the surface. If the feature has an associated 3D model, the depth is measured as the distance from the XY plane of the model to the lowest point of the model below that plane. Depth values are measured with increasing positive values downward. For hydrographic features, the depth is also a measure of the water level relative to the deepest bottom surface.
|Height above Surface Level (HGT)|The height of a feature relative to its surface location. If the feature has no modeled representation, its height is measured as the distance from the surface level (ground or water) to the tallest point of the feature above the surface. If the feature has an associated 3D model, the height is measured as the distance from the XY plane of the model to the highest point of the model above that plane. Height values are measured with increasing positive values upward.

In the current and previous versions of the OGC CDB standard (V1.0, V1.1, V1.2 and V1.3), these attributes come from FACC; however, based on the application schema profile these concepts can be defined accordingly by considering the general content requirements.
