== TIFF Implementation Guidance

Formerly Annex B in the OGC CDB Best Practices.

The conventions define how TIFF files are interpreted by a CDB-compliant TIFF reader; the stated conventions supersede or replace related aspects of this annotated standard.  Unless stated otherwise, CDB-compliant TIFF readers shall/will ignore any data that fails to conform to the stated conventions. Please refer to TIFF 6.0 (1992).

While the above-mentioned sample data formats are possible, CDB clients expect image and DEM data to be in the format as specified in the CDB conventions and constraints.
|SMinSampleValue Tag (80) |CDB-compliant TIFF readers do not consider the SMinSampleValue TIFF tag.
|SMazSampleValue (81) |CDB-compliant TIFF readers do not consider the SMaxSampleValue TIFF tag.
